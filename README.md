# Ambilight-project
I created an ambilight system for my TV to improve experience when gaming. Feel free to use as you please.

## What is ambilight?
Ambilight is a feature that's been around for quite a while that will give your TV a backlight that corresponds to the colors shown on the TV - a blue skye will give a blue backlight. The cool thing is that it changes with the picture. Philips has recently tried to bring it back, but those things are expensive AF and doesn't work any better than something homemode.
If you try to start an ambilight project from scratch you will quickly find a billion guides that all have their own take on things. 

So there are two main ways of doing this. I have seen some projects that uses a Webcamera to record whats on the screen, but this seemed to me to be a shitty solution that cannot possible be giving an acceptable result. So this setup **DOES NOT USE WEBCAM**, instead it uses Hyperbian and USB capture mode. This is done through a dongle that is able to convert the signal for us. All this will be better explained down the guide don't worry.

This overall setup is straightforward and will work 100% on HDMI input sources. Depending on your splitter, and it's abaility to split and strip images of protection you may or may not be able to use newer HDCP for example, I have not had this problem. Considering this requires an external source, this means you won't get ambilight effects on anything seen through a Smart TV's OS as this is not an HDMI input source. The Netflix app on your TV won't work, in other words.

I use it for two things: 
1. My Xbox
2. My Chromecast

Using a Chromecast is great because it lets you turn literally any streaming app on your phone into a HDMI input source, meaning we can watch netflix with ambilight as long as it's running through the chromecast.

Oh, and this thing hooked up to the Xbox is lit AF. It looks really good and you're gonna be in awe the first time you get it working :-)


# WIP - Tutorial for building
